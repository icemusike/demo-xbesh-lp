   <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
   <p><em>Last Updated&nbsp;– 1 January 2025</em></p>

   <p>Thank you for choosing xBesh AI ( “xBesh”, “we”, “us”, or “our” ). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any personal information you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit <strong>xbesh.com</strong>, <strong>app.xbesh.com</strong>, or any other site or service under our control (collectively, the “Service”).</p>

   <h2>1.&nbsp;Information We Collect</h2>
   <p>We collect information to provide and improve our Service, communicate with you, and comply with legal obligations.</p>

     <li><strong>Content&nbsp;you create using xBesh AI</strong> – project descriptions, prompts, files, or other materials you upload or generate via the platform.</li>
     <li><strong>Usage data</strong> – IP address, browser type, device identifiers, pages visited, referring/exit pages, date/time stamps, clicks, and other diagnostic data collected automatically through cookies and similar technologies.</li>
     <li><strong>Payment data</strong> – when you purchase a subscription, our payment processor (Stripe) collects your credit-card number and other details. xBesh only receives a secure token and basic billing data (e.g., last four digits, card brand, expiration).</li>
   </ul>

   <ul>
     <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the Service;</li>
     <li>Process and manage subscriptions, invoices, and payments;</li>
     <li>Personalize the user experience and develop new features;</li>

   </ul>

   <h2>3.&nbsp;Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK Users)</h2>
   <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, our legal bases for processing your personal data are:</p>
   <ul>
     <li><strong>Contract</strong> – to provide the Service you request;</li>
     <li><strong>Legitimate Interests</strong> – to improve and secure the Service, market to existing customers, and prevent fraud;</li>
     <li><strong>Consent</strong> – for cookies or marketing communications where required; and</li>
     <li><strong>Legal Obligation</strong> – to comply with applicable laws.</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>4.&nbsp;Cookies &amp; Tracking Technologies</h2>
   <p>We use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to recognise your browser, improve site performance, remember preferences, and analyse traffic. You can control cookies through your browser settings; however, disabling cookies may affect site functionality.</p>

   <h2>5.&nbsp;How We Share Information</h2>
   <p>We never sell your personal data. We share information only as described below:</p>

     <li><strong>Service Providers</strong> – third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., hosting, analytics, payment processing, customer support) and who are bound by confidentiality obligations.</li>
     <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong> – in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, provided that the recipient agrees to this Privacy Policy.</li>

   </ul>

   <h2>6.&nbsp;International Transfers</h2>
   <p>We are headquartered in the United States and may process your information in the US and other countries that may not provide the same data-protection laws as your jurisdiction. We rely on appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses when transferring personal data from the EEA/UK.</p>

   <h2>7.&nbsp;Data Security &amp; Retention</h2>
   <p>We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information. Despite our efforts, no security measure is completely secure. We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this Policy or as required by law.</p>

   <h2>8.&nbsp;Your Privacy Rights</h2>
   <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict the processing of your personal data, or to object to certain processing or request data portability.
