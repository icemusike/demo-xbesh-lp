    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated – 1 January 2025</em></p>

    <p>These Terms of Service (the "<strong>Terms</strong>") govern your use of the websites, products, and services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>") provided by <strong>xBesh AI, Inc.</strong> ("<strong>xBesh</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", or "<strong>our</strong>").

    <h2>3. Subscriptions, Fees &amp; Payments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Certain features require a paid subscription ("<strong>Plan</strong>"). Prices and inclusions are described on our pricing page (or in-app).</li>
      <li>All fees are in U.S. dollars unless stated otherwise and are exclusive of applicable taxes.</li>
      <li>Payments are processed by our third-party payment processor (e.g., Stripe). By subscribing, you authorise xBesh to charge your selected payment method on a recurring basis until you cancel.</li>
      <li>You can cancel at any time via your account settings. Cancelling stops future renewals; payments already processed are non-refundable except as required by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to misuse the Service or help anyone else do so. For example, you will not:</p>

      <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Service;</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service; or</li>
      <li>Use automated means (bots, scrapers) to access the Service without prior written consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All rights, title, and interest in and to the Service, including software, text, images, trademarks, and logos, are owned by xBesh or its licensors.

    <h2>6. AI-Generated Output</h2>
    <p>The Service may generate software code, text, or other content ("<strong>Output</strong>") based on your prompts. You are solely responsible for reviewing Output before using it in production and ensuring that its use complies with applicable laws, third-party licences, and intellectual-property rights.</p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without notice, if you violate these Terms or if we reasonably believe suspension is necessary to protect the Service or other users.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service and all content are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE." xBesh disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
